# Active Directory Overview
- What is Active Directory?
  - Directory service developed by Microsoft to manage Windows
    domain networks.
   - Stores information related to objects, such as Computers, Users,
    Printers, etc.
  - Think about it as a phone book for Windows
  - Authenticates using Kerberos tickets.
  - Non-Windows devices, such as Linux machines, firewalls, etc. can also
   authenticate to Active Directory via RADIUS or LDAP.
  
  # Why Active Directory Pentest ?
- Active Directory is the most commonly used identity management
service in the corporate organization infrastructure.
- Can be exploited without ever attacking patchable exploits.
- Instead, we abuse features, trusts, components, and more.

# Physical Component

 - Domain Controllers
  - A domain controller is a server with the AD DS server role installed that has
    specifically been promoted to a domain controller.

   - Host a copy of the AD DS directory store
   - Provide authentication and authorization services
   - Replicate updates to other domain controllers in the domain and forest
   - Allow administrative access to manage user accounts and network resources

 - AD DS Data Store
   - The AD DS data store contains the database files and processes that store and
     manage directory information for users, services, and applications

  - The AD DS data store:
      - Consists of the Ntds.dit file
      - Is stored by default in the %SystemRoot%\NTDS folder on all domain
        controllers.

      - Is accessible only through the domain controller processes and protocols.
