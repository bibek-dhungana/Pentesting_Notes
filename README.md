  - https://github.com/hmaverickadams/External-Pentest-Checklist/blob/main/TCMS%20-%20External%20Pentest%20Checklist.xlsx

# Rules of engagements
- The rules of the engagements & overall scope , roles , responsibilities of the service provider + client are defined in ROE.

# Verifying scope
- Verifying the given scope by the client before starting the assessment.

# Client Communication
- Time to time communication to the client point of contact is necessary in case of critical findings or other necessities.

# Attack Strategy
- Think of external pentests like home security
- Low chance of RCE, high chance of weak passwords.
- OSINT is your best friend ( and logical guessing)

# Vulnerability scanning
- Scanning the target IP ranges/addresses using tools like nessus.

# Reviewing and Extracting Information
- Reviewing the findings & infromation of the vulnerability scanning from the nessus or other scanners.
- Export the scan result as a .nessus file & parse it via avaliable nessus parsers.

# OSINT Overview
- Osint overview defines the publicly avaliable information that can leverage an attack.

# Hunting Breached Credentials
- While performing external penetration testing, breached credentials is very much useful to leverage an attack that help to access the internal system.
- Some resources are:
